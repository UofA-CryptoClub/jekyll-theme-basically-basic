The Blockchain and Cryptoasset Association at the University of Alberta has partnered with Vitruvian Innovations and Capital Energy Corporation to host a case competition. For those who don't know, in a case competition, participants strive to develop the best solution to a case study within an allocated time frame. This competition will require a blockchain-based solution, but will not require any technical (computer science or cryptography) knowledge.
We will collect signups until March 19, 2018. Following that, we will distribute the case with more formal details and guidelines. Teams will be given until March 30, 2018 to come up with their solution. Teams can be a maximum of 3 members, and individuals are also welcome to participate. The prize for the winning team will be $500.

Notice: a minimum of 10 teams (whether 1, 2 or 3 person) must sign up for the case competition to move forward.
