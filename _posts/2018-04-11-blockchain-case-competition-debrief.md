The Blockchain and Cryptoasset Association held its first official, open event: a blockchain themed case competition. Over 20 teams of 1-3 members registered to compete, and 6 finalists were chosen to present their proposals at the windup. 

Over 25 people attended the windup event on April 7, 2018, where finalists pitched their solutions to a panel of judges. Originally it was intended for there to be a single winner, but due to the high quality of proposals, a 1st and 2nd place prize was awarded.

The case is summarized below, in addition to summaries of the finalists’ solutions and links to their full proposals. 

**Option 1:**
Research and identify challenges, shortcomings, and inefficiencies of current carbon-pricing regimes – you can choose to focus on one specific mandate (Western Climate Initiative, Alberta Climate Leadership Plan, or any other international model of your choosing), or you can take a general macro-approach and analyze industry shortcomings as a whole. Some examples could include, but are not limited to:
Illiquidity in the trading of carbon offset credits
Segmented and fractured policy mandates
Carbon accounting issues – additionality, auditing, double-accounting, etc.
Develop a conceptual construct (no coding) focused on introducing a blockchain-based solution to your chosen issue.
Summarize your findings and solution in a written proposal document (1,000 words)

**Option 2:**
Try tackling the following problem: Develop a protocol that will allow for human verification of transactions, accounting, and audits to occur in a decentralized network of industry experts, from offset origination to retirement. Once an audit occurs and is broadcasted to the network, how is it validated to ensure its accuracy without the oversight of a central authority? What does the incentive system that maintains the blockchain integrity look like? Public or private ledger? Permission-based or open source? How does the reward system work (and what is the reward)? How does data mining occur? These could all be questions to think about if going this route.
Carbon audits aren’t an exact science – they often rely on statistical assumptions and extrapolations, approximations, and best guesses. Due to this, 2 qualified, professional auditors may evaluate the same project, yet calculate different offset originations based on their interpretation of the data. In order to implement a decentralized blockchain protocol to store data and originate carbon credits, there must be a consensus protocol that involves elements of manual human verification.

Title: Carbon Coin 
Team: Martha Han, Hylann Ma, Henry Su
Summary: Currently, companies self-enter carbon emissions into an online system, with audits periodically conducted. To improve transparency and accountability, instead companies will upload their carbon-auditable records to IPFS. The government will issue Carbon Coins, proportional to obligated emissions targets. Companies will hire 2 independent auditors, granted access to the records on IPFS. Smart contract will issue a reward to both auditors if their audits agree within tolerance, but if not, a special auditor will be contracted.  The system proposed would function as a private, permissioned ledger.
